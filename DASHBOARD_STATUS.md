## 🚀 **Currently Running**

- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000

## 🔧 **To Fix Backend Issue**

The backend has trouble starting due to the single quote in the folder path `Gssoc'25`. Here are solutions:

### **Option 1: Rename Folder (Recommended)**
```bash
# Rename the folder to remove the single quote
ren "Gssoc'25" "Gssoc25"
```

### **Option 2: Use IDE**
- Open the `agriBazaar-backend` folder in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Run the `AgriBazaarBackendApplication.java` main method

### **Option 3: Copy to Different Location**
```bash
# Copy project to C:\temp\ or another location without special characters
```
